Mathematical Model for InterviewXpert Application

1. Resume Analysis Algorithm (Keyword Matching)
-----------------------------------------------
The resume analysis feature calculates a compatibility score based on keyword overlap between the Job Description (JD) and the Resume.

Let T_job be the set of unique keywords extracted from the Job Description.
Let T_resume be the set of unique keywords extracted from the Resume text.

Preprocessing (Tokenization):
For any text input, the set of keywords T is generated by:
1. Converting text to lowercase.
2. Removing punctuation.
3. Splitting text into individual words (tokens).
4. Filtering out "Stop Words" (common words like "the", "and", "is", etc.) defined in the set S_stop.
5. Filtering out words with length <= 2.

Mathematical Formula for Score (S):
Let M be the set of matched keywords (Intersection):
M = T_job ∩ T_resume

The Match Score (S) is calculated as the percentage of job keywords found in the resume (Recall):
S = round( (|M| / |T_job|) * 100 )

Where:
|M| is the number of matched keywords.
|T_job| is the total number of unique keywords in the job description.

Logic:
IF S >= 70: Classification = "Excellent match"
IF 40 <= S < 70: Classification = "Good match"
IF S < 40: Classification = "Low match"



3. Interview Statistics Aggregation
-----------------------------------
The Candidate Dashboard displays summary statistics derived from the set of all interviews (I).

Let I be the set of all interview records for a candidate.
Let s_i be the status of interview i, where i ∈ I.

Total Interviews (N_total):
N_total = |I|

Hired Count (N_hired):
N_hired = Σ (1 if s_i == "hired", else 0) for all i ∈ I

Rejected Count (N_rejected):
N_rejected = Σ (1 if s_i == "rejected", else 0) for all i ∈ I

Shortlisted Count (N_shortlisted):
N_shortlisted = Σ (1 if s_i == "shortlisted", else 0) for all i ∈ I

4. Sorting Algorithms
---------------------
The application sorts lists of jobs or interviews based on specific criteria.

Let A and B be two items in the list.

a) Sort by Date (Newest First):
   Let t_A and t_B be the timestamps (in milliseconds) for items A and B.
   Comparison Function f(A, B) = t_B - t_A
   If f > 0, B comes before A.

b) Sort by Score (High to Low):
   Let S_A and S_B be the numeric scores for items A and B.
   Comparison Function f(A, B) = S_B - S_A

5. Scoring Logic (3 Key Metrics)
--------------------------------
The platform evaluates candidates using three distinct scores.

a) Resume Score (S_resume):
   S_resume = (Matching Keywords / Total Job Keywords) * 100

b) Q&A Score (S_qa):
   Average of scores received for each interview question.
   S_qa = (Sum of Question Scores) / (Total Number of Questions)

c) Overall Score (S_overall):
   Weighted average of Resume and Q&A scores.
   S_overall = (S_resume * 0.4) + (S_qa * 0.6)
